[We decided](https://github.com/rafaelrinaldi/pure/issues/123) to restrict our support to the **major `Fish` versions only** (currently **`3.x` and `4.x`**).

This decision is based on the availability of those versions on LTS Ubuntu thanks to the official PPAs' for [`Fish 3.x` PPA][fish-3-ppa] and [Fish 4.x][fish-4-ppa] as well as on others [distributions repositories](https://pkgs.org/search/?q=%22friendly%20interactive%20shell%22).

As of May 2025, we should:

* :tada: Start supporting Fish `4.x` and above ;
* :warning: Set minimal support for `3.x` branch to `3.3.1` and above (as per [Ubuntu LTS standard security maintenance policy][ubuntu-lts-policy]) ;
* :x:  drop support for `2.x` ;

### :earth_africa: Energy footprint

To **reduce our energy footprint**, we will only test:

* versions available [on latest Ubuntu LTS, MacOS and NixOS](https://repology.org/project/fish/versions) (see [availability](https://pkgs.org/download/fish)) ;
* [latest two versions of Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/).
