### Disable Git info

Now you have an option to disable Git info in the prompt with the `pure_enable_git` parameter. Just set it to `false` in your `config.fish` as usual if you have performance problems in big repositories.

This is a temporary workaround until we'll add Git async support in `v3.0.0`.
