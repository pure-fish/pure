## ðŸ›  Show number of jobs in prompt 

The feature is disabled by default and **can be enabled by adding** in the user's `config.fish` file:
```fish
set pure_show_jobs true
```

Additionally, the default color is `normal` to match the [zsh example](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure/wiki#show-number-of-jobs-in-prompt). This is also configurable.

This is a port of a [zsh-version feature](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure/wiki/Customizations,-hacks-and-tweaks#show-number-of-jobs-in-prompt).
